# firstEngine Version 0.0.1
This is my first ever attempt at a game engine, written mostly in JS. This code
is being written fully test driven, with tests written in jasmine.


##features:
As this engine is currently in development, features are going to be split into
implemented, in development, and planned.

###Implemented:
-


###In development:
- Core engine


###Planned:
- Core movement module
- Core physics module
- Physics-collisions


##STRUCTURE
The engine is structured in a fairly simple fashion. The main gametime component
is in `src/engine/`, and all of the additional modules are located in `src/module_name`


##INSTRUCTIONS
Given the fact that describing how to use a game engine is no simple task,
please excuse this section being long.
